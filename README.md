> An easy-to-use facade to Kaltura server with typescript support for action requests, classes and enums.

This library uses `Typescript` files that are transpiled  into `ECMAScript 5` using `commonjs` as a module system.

This library have **_zero dependencies_** at runtime and it can be used in any Javascript project. Those who are using Typescript will benefit even more.

 >Visit our [live demonstration](https://goo.gl/c02JX2) for code snippets and common use cases.

- [x] Represent each kaltura types as a typed object with simple API.
- [x] Use generated action classes to easily access Kaltura services.
- [x] Invoke multi-requests against the server.
  - [x] Handle each request response separately.
  - [x] Expose interceptors to handle multi-request responses together.

$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## Running integration tests
- In `src/tests` folder you should duplicate file `tests-config.tpl.ts` and name it `tests-config.ts`.
- Modify the file content to include valid information.
- Run `npm run test` to test the library

> If you want to test the library against the production server use the following as the endpoint in the config file: http://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/index.php/
